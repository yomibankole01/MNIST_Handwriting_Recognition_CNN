# MNIST_Handwriting_Recognition_CNN

## Project Objective: 
- Implement a Deep Neural Network with Keras for recognizing handwritten digits in the MNIST dataset.

## Dataset Description
- The MNIST dataset comprises 70,000 28x28 black-and-white images of handwritten digits extracted from two NIST databases.
- There are 60,000 images in the training dataset and 10,000 images in the validation dataset, one class per digit so a total of 10 classes.

## Steps
1. Loaded and explored the data.
2. Conducted initial exploratory data analysis (EDA).
3. Prepared and preprocessed the data.
4. Constructed the neural network model.
5. Evaluated the modelâ€™s performance.
6. Enhanced the model by adjusting its depth.

## Quantifiable Results:
- Loss: 0.1261
- Accuracy: 0.9656
